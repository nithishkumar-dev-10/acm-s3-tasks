## Introduction

This repository consolidates all tasks completed as part of the **ACM SIG-AI recruitment process**. It contains three independent machine learning projects, each corresponding to a distinct stage of the selection process and reflecting an increasing level of technical scope — from single-model feature engineering, to multi-model comparison, to a complete multi-stage system architecture.

The projects are structured to be reviewed sequentially, as each builds on the methodology and evaluation practices established in the previous one.

## Progression

```
Feature Engineering Challenge
        ↓
     WorkPulse
        ↓
TransReliant Cascade
```

| Stage | Core Competency Demonstrated |
|---|---|
| **Feature Engineering Challenge** | Extracting predictive signal from weakly correlated, anonymized data under a fixed-model constraint |
| **WorkPulse** | Comparative model evaluation, class-imbalance handling, and prediction explainability |
| **TransReliant Cascade** | Multi-model system design — a classification stage feeding a conditionally-triggered regression stage, with leakage-aware architecture |

Each project increases in scope relative to the last: single-model optimization → multi-model comparison → multi-stage pipeline architecture.

## Repository Overview

| Project Name | Stage | Status | Primary Focus |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| **Feature Engineering Challenge** | Week 1 | Completed | Feature engineering under a fixed model constraint (Logistic Regression only) |
| **WorkPulse** | Week 2 | Completed | Model comparison, tuning, and explainability (SHAP) on imbalanced data |
| **TransReliant Cascade** | Final Project | Completed | Two-stage ML system: classification → regression cascade |

## 01 · Feature Engineering Challenge

**Dataset:** Santander Customer Transaction Prediction (Kaggle)

A binary classification task constrained to a single model family — Logistic Regression, with no ensembling and no external data permitted. The objective was to raise recall from a baseline of **0.83 to 0.88+** through feature engineering alone.

**Approach:**
- Constructed frequency-encoded, row-wise statistical, and pairwise interaction features to surface signal from 200 anonymized, weakly correlated columns
- Diagnosed a **spurious-recall failure mode**, where naive `class_weight='balanced'` inflated recall by over-predicting the positive class rather than learning genuine signal
- Replaced the blunt class-weight switch with a **tuned weight ratio combined with a calibrated decision threshold**

**Result:** Final test recall of **0.888**, with a precision/F1 trade-off that was deliberately chosen and justified over the naive balanced-weight alternative.

## 02 · WorkPulse

**Dataset:** IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset (Kaggle)

An employee attrition prediction system designed to help HR teams identify at-risk employees ahead of resignation.

**Approach:**
- Benchmarked **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost** using cross-validated hyperparameter tuning
- Engineered **10 domain-informed features** (e.g. `WorkloadScore`, `LoyaltyIndex`, `StagnationRisk`) to capture burnout and turnover risk beyond the raw dataset
- Addressed class imbalance using **SMOTE**, applied strictly to the training split to prevent leakage
- Evaluated model explainability with **SHAP** and quantified error trade-offs via False Positive/Negative rate analysis

**Result:** XGBoost selected as the production model (**F1-macro 0.7165, ROC-AUC 0.7963**), offering the strongest balance between missed attrition risk and unnecessary retention effort.

## 03 · TransReliant Cascade

**Dataset:** Indian Railway Ticket Confirmation Dataset (Kaggle)

A two-stage cascade system that predicts ticket confirmation status and, for passengers flagged as unconfirmed, estimates the severity of their waitlist position.

**System design:**
- **Stage 1 (Classification):** Predicts `Confirmation Status` from booking and journey features
- **Stage 2 (Regression):** Triggered only for the subset flagged "Not Confirmed" by Stage 1, predicting `Waitlist Position`
- Stage 2 is trained on ground-truth labels but **routed by Stage 1's predictions at inference time**, avoiding compounded errors and label leakage between stages

**Pipeline scope:** EDA → data cleaning → feature engineering (`seat_pressure`, `booking_urgency_bucket`) → independent preprocessing per stage → per-stage model comparison and tuning → threshold optimization → system-level evaluation, supported by a CLI demo, architecture diagram, and full experiment log.

## Closing Note

This repository documents a deliberate, stage-by-stage progression in applied machine learning — from feature-level optimization, through comparative model evaluation, to the design of a complete multi-model system. Each project builds on the methodology and evaluation standards established in the previous one, with the broader objective of developing production-oriented AI engineering skills.
